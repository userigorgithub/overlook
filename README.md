# Overlook Hotel

### Final Solo Project

## Overview

Overlook Hotel was a final solo project which used Javascript as primary front-end language (along with html and css) as well as API requests (GET and POST). It allowed deeper understanding in fetching and posting requests and their interaction with front-end programming languages.
